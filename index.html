        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <p>
          From a young age, we are pressured to change our appearance and strive
          to meet society's standards for beauty.
          <br />This is especially true for black women in regards to our hair.
        </p>
        <p>
          Around 2010, I began the journey of self-acceptance and embracing my
          natural hair. <br />This journey has helped me embrace my culture and
          love myself more fully, without letting others dictate how I should
          look.
          <br />
          While embarking on this journey was empowering and enlightening, there
          were still many moments of frustration and sadness which made the
          routine of caring for my hair feel like a chore. <br />But embracing
          this ritual as <e>self-care</e> has helped in changing my experience
          with my hair routine and my relationship with my hair.
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          While not every hair care session is perfect (I'm still human üôÇ),
          caring for my hair, like exercising or taking a relaxing bath, is one
          of my favorite ways of practicing self-care.
          <br />The act helps me slow down, feel refreshed, and boosts my
          confidence.
        </p>
        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p>
          <a
            href="https://www.verywellmind.com/self-care-strategies-overall-stress-reduction-3144729"
            target="_blank"
            ><strong>VeryWell Mind</strong></a
          >
          defines <em>self-care</em> as ‚Äúa conscious act a person takes in order
          to promote their own physical, mental, and emotional health.‚Äù
          <br />Practicing self care can come in many different forms, like
          exercising, journaling, or <em>caring for your hair.</em> <br />

          Here at Love Your Hair, we recognize that self-care has been
          commercialized.<br />
          This community is not about selling you products you don't need,
          striving for society's ideal, or meeting another person's idea of
          beauty.
          <br />We hope only to create a community that uplifts and promotes
          self-love, embraces hair care as self-care, and guides women in
          crafting routines they enjoy, which help them celebrate themselves and
          feel their very best. <br /><strong>
